Hi, my name is Gerardo Rodriguez and I'm currently a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. My current work is in the field of ultrasound stimulation and hearing devices, and I develop stimulation strategies for activating the auditory system, with electrophysiological signals as a feedback system.

I'm interested in data science, and enjoy tackling new problems in different domains. My current open projects consist of working with DS4A Data Science fellowship, working through Aurelien Geron's Hands-On Machine Learning book, and solving Google Foobar problems.

I'm looking to expand my skillsets in machine learning and signal processing!

If any questions, please reach out to me at gerardorodore@gmail.com


Most of my work here relates to my own personal configuration files. To install my setup, ensure that you have zsh and wget installed:

wget https://raw.github.umn.edu/rodr0283/PersonalFiles/master/dotfiles/startupCygwin.sh?token=AAAjbN3R4K3Qqeo_KZa4ylk9JNS4_aOoks5b3L6lwA%3D%3D
mv startup*.sh?token=AAAjbN3R4K3Qqeo_KZa4ylk9JNS4_aOoks5b3L6lwA%3D%3D startup*.sh
chmod +x startup*.sh
./startup*.sh

Should successfully run.

Configuration files set up for Cygwin, OSX, and Linux.
