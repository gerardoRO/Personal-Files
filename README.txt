Most of my work here relates to my own personal configuration files. To install my setup, ensure that you have zsh and wget installed:

wget https://raw.github.umn.edu/rodr0283/PersonalFiles/master/dotfiles/startupCygwin.sh?token=AAAjbN3R4K3Qqeo_KZa4ylk9JNS4_aOoks5b3L6lwA%3D%3D
mv startup*.sh?token=AAAjbN3R4K3Qqeo_KZa4ylk9JNS4_aOoks5b3L6lwA%3D%3D startup*.sh
chmod +x startup*.sh
./startup*.sh

Should successfully run.

Configuration files set up for Cygwin, OSX, and Linux.
